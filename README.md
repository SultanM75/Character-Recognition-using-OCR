# Character-Recognition-using-OCR
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) also called Optical Character Reader is a system that provides a full alphanumeric recognition of printed or handwritten characters at electronic speed by simply scanning the form. More recently, the term Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) has been used to describe the process of interpreting image data, in particular alphanumeric text. Function of OCR Forms containing characters images can be scanned through scanner and then recognition engine of the OCR system interpret the images and turn images of handwritten or printed characters into ASCII data (machine-readable characters). Therefore, OCR allows users to quickly automate data capture from forms, eliminate keystrokes to reduce data entry costs and still maintain the high level of accuracy required in forms processing applications. Features of OCR The technology provides a complete form processing and +documents capture solution. Usually, OCR uses a modular architecture that is open, scaleable and workflow controlled using Google's Tesseract engine. It includes forms definition, scanning, image pre-processing, and recognition capabilities.
